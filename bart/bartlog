# BART wrapper to be run from cron and output
#  changes to syslog.
#
# Modified 3/8/10: Report creation of initial manifest in-band (syslog),
#                       this will warn us if someone has destroyed our manifest
#                       to cover their tracks.
# Modified 10/23/17: Upgrade bash syntax; protect IFS; Email results;
#                       temporarily disable logging.
# Modified 10/23/17: Upgrades to bash syntax; reeable logging
# Modified 12/15/17: Fix logger calls and use -f option to log diff details.
